    "introduction": "Molecular biology explores the intricate mechanisms that control cellular processes by examining the roles and interactions of DNA, RNA, and proteins. As a bridge between genetics and biochemistry, it seeks to understand how molecular components contribute to the function and regulation of living systems.Molecular Biology Virtual Lab II offers a set of interactive experiments designed to simulate key techniques used in modern molecular biology research. These include<br><ul><li>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)—amplifying DNA segments to study gene expression, mutations, and more.</li> <li>Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE)—separating proteins based on size and charge for analysis.</li><li>Electroblotting—transferring proteins from gels to membranes for identification.</li><li>Plasmid Curing—eliminating plasmids from bacteria to study genetic traits and antibiotic resistance.</li><li>Bacteriophage DNA Extraction—isolating phage DNA for molecular and genetic analysis.</li><br>Through these simulations, learners can gain practical insights into laboratory workflows and develop a deeper un Developing a deeper understanding of experimental molecular biology makes it an ideal preparatory tool for real lab environments and advanced studies.",
